- `O(1)` denotes constant running time
- `O(log n)` denotes logarithmic running time
- `O(n)` denotes linear running time
- `O(n log n)` denotes log-linear running time
- `O(n^k)` denotes polynomial running time. Notice that k is a constant
- `O(c^n)` denotes exponential running time. Here a costant is being raised to a power based on the size of the input
