- Simulation models are descriptive, not prescriptive
- Simulation models can be classified along three dimensions:
  1) Deterministic vs Stochastic
  2) Statistic vs Dynamic
  3) Discrete vs Continuous
- Standard deviation shows that if we took more samples from the same distribution, we would get a similar value within the standard deviation
